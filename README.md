### Binary Search Tree, test and visualize 

Following repo first builds the Binary Search Tree BST.java which includes AbstractTree.java, Tree.interface. Then in the TestBST.java checks the previously given classes.

A tree is a classic data structure with many important applications. A tree provides a hierarchical organization in which data are stored in the nodes. A binary search tree can be implemented using a linked structure. Recall that lists, stacks, and queues are linear structures that consist of a sequence of elements. A binary tree is a hierarchical structure. It either is empty or consists of an element, called the root, and two distinct binary trees, called the left subtree and right subtree, either or both of which may be empty.

The `#RRGGBB`	length a path is the number of the edges in the path. The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node. The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a level of the tree. Siblings are nodes that share the same parent node. The root of a left (right) subtree of a node is called a left (right) child of the node. A node without children is called a leaf. The height of a nonempty tree is the length of the path from the root node to its furthest leaf. The height of a tree that contains a single node is 0. Conventionally, the height of an empty tree is â€”1. The length of the path from node 60 to 45 is 2. The depth of node 60 is 0, the depth of node 55 is 1, and the depth of node 45 is 2. The height of the tree is 2.
Nodes 45 and 57 are siblings. Nodes 45, 57, 67, and 107 are at the same level. A special type of binary tree called a binary search tree (BST) is often useful. A BST (with no duplicate elements) has the property that for every node in the tree, the value of any node in its left subtree is less than the value of the node, and the value of any node in its right subtree is greater than the value of the node.

### Binary Search Tree, test and visualize 

Following repo first builds the Binary Search Tree BST.java which includes AbstractTree.java, Tree.interface. Then in the TestBST.java checks the previously given classes.

A tree is a classic data structure with many important applications. A tree provides a hierarchical organization in which data are stored in the nodes. A binary search tree can be implemented using a linked structure. Recall that lists, stacks, and queues are linear structures that consist of a sequence of elements. A binary tree is a hierarchical structure. It either is empty or consists of an element, called the root, and two distinct binary trees, called the left subtree and right subtree, either or both of which may be empty.
